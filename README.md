[Visit Live Site](https://rayverse.pages.dev/)

## Project Overview

RayVerse is a full-stack personal portfolio website that I completed independently, aiming to fully showcase my skills and personality to future employers or partners. This project covers the complete product development process:

### Design

I used Figma for UI design and page prototype planning, thinking about the layout, style, and user interaction details to ensure that users have a clear and intuitive experience when browsing.

### Development

- Frontend: Using **React** + **JavaScript** + **Tailwind CSS** to build the single-page application (SPA) with better user experience by implementing state management, basic abuse prevention and user interaction logic.

- Backend: Building API based on **Node.js** + **Express**, use **MongoDB(Mongoose)** for data persistence, and ensure interface security and maintainability.
